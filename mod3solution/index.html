        <p>Combat is a major part of almost every Story you’ll tell and will play a huge part in how your players interact with your Worldspace. To help you control the chaos of combat there are several mechanics that should cover most of what you’ll be dealing with. These are meant to be somewhat self-explanatory and should be used more to keep things moving and keep everyone engaged than to put limits on your player’s creativity. As always, if it sounds cool its allowed, between the mechanics available and the Skills your Heroes will have at their disposal it shouldn’t be too hard to make most of their nonsense happen. One more quick note, and this’ll be repeated several times going forward, For Glory! is not meant to be perfectly balanced. Heroes and Enemies will have different strengths and weaknesses and it’s up to you to use these to tell the story you want to tell. There is no ranking or easy reference system for determining what the best Hero builds are or how deadly an Enemy will be for your party. It’ll be up to you to guide your players in creating Heroes that can accomplish whatever Goals and Aspirations they have and can face the Worldspace you’re creating. It’ll also be on you to place challenges in front of them that they can overcome without feeling cheated when they fail. No doubt it’s a lot but I believe in you.</p>

      <div id="worldspace-tile" class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
        <a id="worldspace" class="text-center"><h3>Worldspace</h3></a>
        <p>For Glory! is played in a wide variety of Worldspaces and even if 2 Narrators are playing in the same Worldspace, they’ll have their own interpretations and additions, so no 2 games are ever the same. Before you start playing, you’ll need to decide on a Worldspace. This encompasses every aspect of the world from the shape of the land to the weather, and the people who live there. You have some options here. You can pick up one of the convenient Worldspace Guides, these will answer nearly every question you or your players can think of in an organized and easy to reference way. On the other extreme you can build your own Worldspace from scratch. A daunting task to say the least but doable and an entertaining and relaxing hobby all its own if that’s a part of the game you love. The last option is to combine the two. Pick up a Worldspace Guide or choose a world that you know well from any other media and shape it to your needs using the tools in this section. This is a great option for having a deep world without investing a huge amount of time into its creation. No matter how you do it, determining your Worldspace will set the tone of your Story. You don’t need to create or memorize every aspect of the Worldspace right off the bat, but you’ll want to have any information you expect to need available and a strong enough understanding of the Worldspace to be able to improvise when necessary.</p>

      <div id="origin-tile" class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <a id="origin"class="text-center"><h3>Origin</h3></a>
        <p>Every Hero starts somewhere, be it a quiet mountain village or an ornate palace. These experiences are what make you the person you’re destined to be. The Origin system is how players describe these experiences and use them to create their Heroes. This should be a collaborative process between you and each player with them telling you what they want and you figuring out how to fit that within your Worldspace. As the Narrator it’s your job to guide your players through the process and to help them end up with Heroes they’re excited to play. They should be doing most of the work here and will find most of what they need in their copy of the Heroes Guide, including a full set of character sheets. Your job here is to answer whatever questions they have about the Worldspace or where they’ll be starting their story. The rest of the section will be laid out similarly to the Worldspace section with each part of the Origin system explained, followed by creation guides, ending with generic samples where they’re appropriate. These generic samples are meant to fit into the majority of Worldspaces and don’t carry any specific lore or flavor. You’ll find more specific options in Worldspace Guides, as well as some of the other Guides. There is some good news here. If your Worldspace is ready to go, you already have a lot of what you need to create the new stuff. As a last note, you’ll find Skills referenced a lot throughout the section. Don’t worry that we’re a bit unclear on the specifics right now. The next section is entirely dedicated to Skills.</p>
